# Google C++ Style Guide

## Introduction
This document defines the coding conventions and style guidelines for C++ code developed at Google. These guidelines should be followed to ensure consistent and readable code across projects.

## Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: Use lowercase letters and underscores for variable names. (e.g., `my_variable`)
- **Functions**: Use lowercase letters and underscores for function names. (e.g., `calculate_average`)
- **Classes**: Use CamelCase for class names. (e.g., `MyClass`)
- **Constants**: Use uppercase letters and underscores for constant names. (e.g., `MAX_NUMBERS`)

## Formatting
- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- **Braces**: Place opening braces on the same line as the corresponding statement. Use the "Egyptian brackets" style.
